                        I created this website as a fun project to showcase various work I've done throughout my studies.
                        I've included some of my favourite coursework, freelance, hackathon, and co-op projects. Please
                        feel free to take a look ðŸ‘€. If you have any, I'd love to hear your thoughts or feedback!
